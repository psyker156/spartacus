class MemoryIOController:
    """
    High level memory access controller. This is meant to be used by ExecutionUnit to simplify memory access.
    This is also responsible for hardware memory mapping in the main memory space.


    Note about memory mapped device:
    Devices are mapped using their start address and mask. Overlaps between devices is NOT
    validated. It is the programmer's job to make sure that he is not overlapping.

    Determining if an address belongs to a memory mapped device:
    Lets say that the device is mapped at 0x10000000 with a 0xFFFF0000 mask
    Address: 0b 0001 0000  0000 0000  0000 0000  0000 0000
    Mask:    0b 1111 1111  1111 1111  0000 0000  0000 0000

    Start:   0b 0001 0000  0000 0000  0000 0000  0000 0000
    End:     0b 0001 0000  0000 0000  1111 1111  1111 1111

    This basically works like a subnet in the IP protocol. Each device has it's own "network address"
    The actual selection process is done using:
    A = the address being accessed
    dS = Start address for a specific device
    dM = Mask for a specific device

    First step, make sure an address is within the range of a device
    dS == A & dM    <- if this condition evaluates to True, the address A belongs the the device

    Let's take the  access address 0b0000 0001  0000 0000  0000 0000  1000 0000
    imagine we have a device mapped at address 0b0000 0001  0000 0000  0000 0000  0000 0000
    with the mask 0b1111 1111

    First, we xor
    A  = 0b0000 0001  0000 0000  0000 0000  1000 0000
    dS = 0b0000 0001  0000 0000  0000 0000  0000 0000
    dM = 0b1111 1111  1111 1111  1111 1111  0000 0000

    formula will be A & dM and then validate the result with dS

    A  = 0b0000 0001  0000 0000  0000 0000  1000 0000
    &
    dM = 0b1111 1111  1111 1111  1111 1111  0000 0000
    r  = 0b0000 0001  0000 0000  0000 0000  0000 0000

    r == dS therefore the address belongs to the device.

    If you need more information about this, simply do online searches about the
    IP protocol and how subnet mask works. You will find plenty of information.
